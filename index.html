Phylotastic is 3 things: the name of an event, a noun referring to an architecture, and an adjective for all things that do something cool <em>and</em> interoperable with phylogenies.

<h2><a href="http://www.evoio.org/Phylotastic">Phylotastic: The event</a></h2>
Phylotastic is the name of a hackathon staged by the HIP (Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenetics) working group during the week of June 4-8, 2012, at the
National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) in Durham, NC.

<h2>Phylotastic: the architecture</h2>
The Phylotastic architecture is a collection of interoperable web services that collectively provide the means to extract a subtree (specified by tips) from any of several large species tree, and to supply branch lengths and provenance annotation.

<h2>Phylotastic: an attribute</h2>
