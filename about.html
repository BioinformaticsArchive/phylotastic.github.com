  <li> <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>The phylotastic project aims to enable flexible, automated access to expert knowledge of the "Tree of Life" of millions of species.  Given a phylogenetic framework that covers most or all species, a user ought to be able to get a subtree tailored to a particular research problem (e.g., a phylogeny of "model organisms") but currently this isn't possible (except in the case of plants, via <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/">Phylomatic</a>)</p>
</li>  
<li><h4>What?</h4>
    <p>Rather than building a single centralized system, we want to promote a design based on loosely coupled components that can be configured so as to solve various problems. To discourage the idea of a single centralized system, we like to use "phylotastic" as an adjective, not a noun.  A system is phylotastic if it meets certain criteria.  A performance-based definition might look like this:</p> 

<blockquote>
An application is phylotastic to the extent that, in response to a user query S, it supplies expert phylogenetic knowledge of S, in a form useful for research purposes, doing so in a timely manner.   
</blockquote>

<p> where S is a list of identifiers such as { "Mus musculus", "Homo sapiens", "Pan troglogytes" }.  Note some aspects of this definition: </p>
<ul class="littleul">
<li>User-oriented - responds to user query
<li>Expert knowledge â€“ exposes expert knowledge to user who is not an expert
<li>Research-ready - provides a robust computable tree with provenance
<li>Timely - provides results quickly enough to support high-volume use-cases 
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Opportunities</h4>
    <p>Currently the organizers are seeking out multiple opportunities to expand on the extraordinary success of the <a href="http://www.evoio.org/wiki/Phylotastic">Phylotastic hackathon</a> that took place June 4 to 8, 2012.  If you are part of an organization that might benefit from further phylotastic development, and may be able to offer partial or full support for another hackathon (or a smaller meeting), please contact one of the PIs (Enrico Pontelli, Rutger Vos, or Arlin Stoltzfus)</p></li>

<li><h4>Credits</h4>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.evoio.org/wiki/PhylotasticParticipants">participants</a> at the <a href="http://www.evoio.org/wiki/Phylotastic">Phylotastic hackathon</a> built this web site and all of the demos. The hackathon was organized by the <a href="http://www.evoio.org/wiki/HIP">HIP</a> working group (Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenies) of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (<a href="http://www.nescent.org">NESCent</a>), which has a <a href="http://www.evoio.org/wiki/HIP#Leadership_Team">Leadership Team</a>  consisting of 10 individuals including the PIs (Enrico Pontelli, Rutger Vos and Arlin Stoltzfus).  We receive support from <a href="http://www.nescent.org">NESCent</a>, <a href="http://www.iplantcollaborative.org">iPlant</a> and <a href="http://synthesis.eol.org/">BioSync</a>.  </p>
